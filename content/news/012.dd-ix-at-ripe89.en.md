Marcel, Klemens, and Melody from DD-IX visited the RIPE community at this year's autumn RIPE event in Prague
RIPE event in Prague. It was a great week with lots of fun and interesting conversations about the future of 
the Internet in Europe. After winning the RIPE Labs article competition with our IXP-from-Scratch series, 
Marcel Koch had the opportunity to give a lightning talk at the General Assembly and introduce DD-IX and our article series.
