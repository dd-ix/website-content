The second Open Tech Meetup took place at TU Dresden at the beginning of August. The DD-IX team reported on current 
developments such as the PoP in City Center DC, new peers, and our upcoming RIPE Labs article series. One outcome of 
this 2nd Tech Meetup is our announcement of the [DDNOG mailing list](https://dd-ix.net/g/ddnog).
After the half-hour presentations, the meetup was opened up for discussions on peering and network technologies. 
Steffen David from I/P/B had a special gift for the DD-IX. Thank you very much for that!

The discussion continued at Altes Wettb√ºro, where we enjoyed the beautiful weather and delicious food together.

Our slides are [online](https://talks.dd-ix.net/otm2024_08/otm2024_08.pdf) available.
