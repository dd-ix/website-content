We would to thank the DD-IX Opening speakers Vint Cerf, Christian Dieckhoff, Thomas Eibeck, Prof. Thomas Horn, Marc Korthaus, Mirjam Kühne, Prof. Thomas Popp, Prof. Matthias Wählisch, and Markus Ziehe. We would also like to thank all those who supported us in the background, such as Thomas Wild, Kerstin Fiering, Tatjana Schiehandl, and SachsenGigaBit GmbH, who allowed us to use their location and provided food and drinks.
René Fichtmüller, Michael Nitsche, Thomas Weible, Sebastian Neuner, Tim Kleefass, Kurt Jaeger and Moritz Frenzel gifted us a special surprise: Two brand new Arista switches, which will help us enormously in the further development of the DD-IX. Thank you!
