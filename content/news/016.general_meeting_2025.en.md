This year, the general assembly took place on October 24 at a restaurant in Dresden's historic city center, offering a charming view of the Dresden Frauenkirche. The agenda included:  
- Technical report  
- Financial report  
- Election of the new board  
- Adoption of a new budget plan for 2026  
- Outlook for the coming year  

After these topics, the evening continued with delicious food and the joy of having so many DD-IX members gathered in one place, resulting in a long, pleasant night filled with good conversations.

With that, nothing stands in the way of DD-IX starting the new year and advancing further exciting developments.

Your DD-IX Team!
