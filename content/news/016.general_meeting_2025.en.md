This year, the general assembly took place on October 24 at a restaurant in Dresden's historic city center, offering a charming view of the Dresden Frauenkirche. The agenda included:

- Technical report  
- Financial report  
- Election of the new board  
- Adoption of a new budget plan for 2026  
- Outlook for the coming year  

The new board consists of Tassilo Tanneberger (chair of the board), Sandra Zander (financial and administrative board), Alexander Kiontke, Marcel Koch, and Thomas Liske. We thank Melody Sofia Eroshevich for her two years of service as chair of the board of DD-IX.

The large turnout of DD-IX members shows that DD-IX Dresden Internet Exchange e.V. has been on the right track since its founding. So: Keep Local Traffic Local – community inspired :)!
The evening was all the more joyful with delicious food and the pleasure of having so many DD-IX members gathered in one place.

With that, nothing stands in the way of DD-IX starting the new year and driving further exciting developments forward. We look forward to the coming year with our (existing and new) members and supporters!

Your DD-IX Team!
