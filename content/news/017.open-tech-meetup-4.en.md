The 4th **DD-IX Open Tech Meetup** took place on November 25 at **TU Dresden**.  
During the event, we presented our newly installed switches, which now enable **100G peering at DD-IX**. 🎉  

Afterward, we briefly introduced our software project [**IXpect**](https://ixpect.net/latest). It has attracted significant attention, and thanks to Arnold Nipper, we had the opportunity to present the software to Internet Exchanges in Latin America and South Asia.

This was followed by a community talk on [**RFC 8950**](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8950) and a presentation of [**SaxNet e.V.**](https://www.sax.de). RFC 8950 specifies how IPv6 addresses can be used as next hops for IPv4 prefixes. This makes the transition to IPv6 easier. Thanks to André Grüneberg for the experiences from BCIX! 
Members and founders of SaxNet e.V. talked about how SaxNet brought the Internet into peoples' homes and fostered a first local Internet Ecosystem with TU Dresden at its heart. Thank you Ulf Kiebert and Jörg Wunsch for the many fascinating historical insights!
