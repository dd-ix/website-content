We hosted our fourth **Open Tech Meetup** on November 25 at **TU Dresden**.  
During the event, we presented our newly installed switches, which now enable **100G peering at DD-IX** 🎉  

Afterward, we briefly introduced our software project [**IXpect**](https://ixpect.net/latest). It has attracted significant attention, and thanks to Arnold Nipper, we had the opportunity to present the software to Internet Exchanges in Latin America and South Asia.

This was followed by a community talk on [**RFC8950**](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8950) and a presentation of [**SaxNet e.V.**](https://sax.de). RFC8950 specifies how IPv6 addresses can be used as next hops for IPv4 prefixes, making the gradual transition to IPv6 easier. SaxNet turned out to be the association that accompanied the early days of the Internet at TU Dresden, offering many fascinating historical insights.

We concluded the evening at [**Raskolnikoff**](https://www.raskolnikoff.de/) with food, drinks, and great conversations.  
All slides from the evening are available [**here**](https://talks.dd-ix.net/otm2025_11/otm2025_11.pdf).
