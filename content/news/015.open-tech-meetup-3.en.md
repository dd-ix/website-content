The OTM-2025-05 (Open Tech Meetup) took place again at the TU Dresden.
The DD-IX team presented the new peers, especially BCIX Outreach and its functionality, the software IXpect (development name audix) to audit the peering LAN for unwanted packets and the lab, which is used to test the newly received hardware from [DD-IX Opening](https://dd-ix.net/en/news/dd-ix-opening) as well as possible for new features.

Furthermore, Marius Feldmann introduced ALASCA, an association that deals with Open Cloud Infrastructure, as well as its possible symbiosis with the Dresden community and what plans they have for the near future.

The discussions continued in the Alter Wettb√ºro with good food.

Our slides are available [online](https://talks.dd-ix.net/otm2025_05/otm2025_05.pdf).
