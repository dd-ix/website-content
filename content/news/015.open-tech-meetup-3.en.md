Our third Open Tech Meetup took place on May 6.
The DD-IX team presented the new peers, especially BCIX Outreach, the open source software IXpect developed by DD-IX to detect unwanted packets in the peering LAN, and the DD-IX Lab, in which we test the newly received hardware from [DD-IX Opening](https://dd-ix.net/en/news/dd-ix-opening) for promising features.

Marius Feldmann presented ALASCA, an association that promotes the Open Cloud Infrastructure, as well as possible symbioses with the Dresden network community. It will be interesting to see what happens with ALASCA at DD-IX in the coming months ;).

The event took place at the Institute of Computer Science at TU Dresden. We would like to thank them for their hospitality.

Our slides are available [online](https://talks.dd-ix.net/otm2025_05/otm2025_05.pdf).
