Marcel, Klemens, and Melody participated at the 89th meeting of the RIPE community. RIPE89 took place in Prague. 
It was a great week with interesting discussions about the future of the Internet in Europe. Our personal highlight was the lightning talk given by Marcel ;). He presented our RIPE Labs Series ["IXP-from-Scratch"](https://labs.ripe.net/author/liske/ixp-from-scratch-building-a-new-ix/) to more than 600 participants. Haven't had the chance to listen to his presentation yet? A recorded version is available on the [RIPE89 web page](https://ripe89.ripe.net/archives/video/1542/).

We are looking forward to meet all our friends at the next RIPE.
