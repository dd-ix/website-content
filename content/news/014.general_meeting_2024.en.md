The general meeting of an association is an important event every year to bring members together, foster new ideas, and report on activities. We held our first general meeting on December 2, 2024 at the Faculty of Computer Science at TU Dresden. The DD-IX board reported on the finances, achievements, and events of the past year and gave an outlook for the 2025. Be prepared for another year of exciting developments of DD-IX.
