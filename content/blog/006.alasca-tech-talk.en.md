The [ALASCA e.V.](https://alasca.cloud) is an association that aims for an open and sovereign cloud infrastructure.
At the [ALALASCA Tech Talk #15](https://alasca.cloud/en/alasca-tech-talk-15/), we talked about the principles of the Internet, details about BGP, and the advantages of an Internet Exchange Point, since cloud infrastructures benefit from a reliable and community-drive Internet as well. As a special bonus, we gave some first insights about the technical DD-IX infrastructure.

The presentation is available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ieWTCBEq5IA).

Many thanks to [ALASCA e.V.](https://alasca.cloud)! to give us the opportunity.
