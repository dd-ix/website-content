The [ALASCA e.V.](https://alasca.cloud) has invited us to give the [#15](https://alasca.cloud/en/alasca-tech-talk-15/) ALASCA Tech Talk. 
In this talk, [Matthias WÃ¤hlisch](https://netd.cs.tu-dresden.de/about/waehlisch) and [Tassilo Tanneberger](https://tanneberger.me) explain 
BGP basics, which function an Internet Exchangen Point fulfills and how the DD-IX was constructed.

A few days later we organised the [first DD-IX Open Tech Meetup](https://dd-ix.net/en/event/open-tech-meeting-2024-05). We were very happy to welcome a part of the Dresden network community in the premises of the TU Dresden.
We would especially like to thank [Thomas Liske](https://ibh.social/@liske) for the excellent presentation about our infrastructure.
Afterwards, there were many ideas and considerations to discuss over drinks and snacks.

We took part in the BCIX Roundtable in mid-May. It was another interesting evening with presentations and a cheerful exchange with many familiar and new faces.
It was very nice to meet all our friends, supporters and acquaintances again.
