Last thursday, 05.10.2023, the founders and supporters of the DD-IX gathered to celebrate the successful foundation of the association. The previous meeting was an important step on the way to realize the  goals of our association. During the meeting, the association's bylaws were adopted, board members  were elected, and the association's long-term visions and plans were discussed.

The meeting started with a warm welcome, where the participants got to know each other in a relaxed atmosphere. With raised glasses, the guests toasted to the promising future of the association and took the opportunity to network with the other participants in interesting conversations while enjoying 
delicious catering. The founding ceremony of the DD-IX marks a significant step towards the establishment of an Internet Exchange for Dresden. We can look forward to the coming developments and progress of the association.
